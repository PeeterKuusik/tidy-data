## Code Book

this is codebook for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (UCI HAR Dataset).
Running code in file "run_analysis.r" will produce 2 different datasets and also csv fail.
There are two output files:
"a" - independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
"dataset2"- tidy and merged dataset with mean and standart deviation measurement

All units are same and have not been tranformed
All labels correspond to labels in original dataset

Columnnames in "a" and "dataset2"
